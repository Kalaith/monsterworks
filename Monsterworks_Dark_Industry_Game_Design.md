# Monsterworks: Dark Industry
## Game Design Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 22, 2025  
**Project:** Factory Automation with Monster Evolution

---

## 🎯 Game Overview

### Core Concept
**Monsterworks: Dark Industry** is a factory automation game where traditional machinery is replaced by living monsters who serve as workers, processors, and infrastructure. Players guide hunted monsters in building their own industrial civilization, turning the classic "heroes farm monsters" narrative on its head.

### Genre & Inspirations
- **Primary Genre:** Factory Automation / Logistics Optimization
- **Core Inspirations:**
  - **Factorio/Satisfactory:** Production chains, optimization, scaling complexity
  - **The Settlers:** Transport logistics, "living" feel of creatures carrying goods
  - **Dungeon Keeper/Overlord:** Villainous theme making the "evil" side sympathetic

### Core Fantasy
You are the collective will of hunted monsters, guiding them to reclaim their dignity and carve out a new homeland. Where adventurers once farmed them for loot, they now band together, pooling their strange abilities to build a thriving, self-sufficient industrial refuge.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

### 1. Survival Gathering
Start with a few weak monsters (slimes, goblins) scavenging for scraps, bones, and fungus in a ruined wilderness.

### 2. Collective Crafting
Build primitive monster "structures": slime pits, bone kilns, spider silk looms. Monsters themselves become the machines.

### 3. Emergent Industry
Monsters discover industry not out of progress, but necessity. Slimes refine metals, trolls hammer stone, ants create transport networks.

### 4. Evolution & Optimization
Evolve your workforce to create more efficient production chains. Balance different monster species for optimal resource flow.

### 5. Defense & Growth
Hero raids periodically attack, forcing balance between production chains and defenses. Use logistics monsters for defense without crippling production.

### 6. Belonging
Long-term goal: create a monstrous civilization where each species has its place, evolving into a society with its own values.
